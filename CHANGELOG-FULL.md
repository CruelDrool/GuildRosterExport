### Added
- Option "Style" for formats HTML, JSON, XML, and YAML. They can now be outputted in 3 styles. 
	- **Beautified** makes the output look really organized and easy to read but uses a lot of text characters, lines, and space. 
	- **Compacted** removes many unnecessary text characters and puts each entry in the guild roster on one line each.
	- **Minified** removes unnecessary text characters and puts everything on one single line to save the most amount of space.
- Own custom way of handling translations. Supports swapping localization.
- Ability to change the addon's localization.
- A test/preview roster for characters without a guild.
- Support for debug logging using [DebugLog](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/debuglog) by [expelliarm5s](https://www.curseforge.com/members/expelliarm5s).
- Support for all locales. Localization enabled on CurseForge.
- Some guard rails around the auto-export events.
	- Limit triggering `C_GuildInfo.GuildRoster()` to only at login or when reloading UI.
	- Check that there are enough rows returned from `GetGuildRosterInfo()`.
